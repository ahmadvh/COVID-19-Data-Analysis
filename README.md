# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
COVID-19 from a data science perspective 

As a retro virus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a fully grown pandemic, infecting more than 200 thousand people as of 18th March regardless of their nationalities. As data enthusiasts it is our common interest to make data into information by connecting the dots and filter the truth from the pile of hazardous information. If we fail to do so, the misinformation regardless of its’ sources will harm not only a common man who’s unable to visualize the data as information but also the entire course of humanity in a very negative way regardless of Governments’ caring efforts towards its’ citizens.
While finding the truth might seem very easy living in the most connected era since the dawn of humanity, but in practice it is very difficult. As an example, from a Quora answer regarding the multiple waves of the viral spread (link below) which will sound not very scientifically baseless for some of the readers with a bit of knowledge in Evolutionary Dynamics related to fitness landscaping and epidemic modelling that lackadaisically contradicts the essential measures taken at this moment. We have to fact check and cross-validate all of the possible scenarios so that we can always be one step ahead of the nature of the virus.
Starting from the very basic but important analysis of publicly available data we’ve found some interesting results in terms of the correlation between two rates (The death rate and Spread rate) and some probable physical explanation backed-up by numerous news articles.
The goal of the GitHub repository is to not only to discover the truth about the dynamics but also to model the probable statistics of consecutive waves in coming time while debunking the misinformation. At the same time the goal of YouTube channel will be to ease the complexity of the analysis and explain them to a common man. With a strong believe that all minds together can achieve the goal of staying steps ahead of the statistics of the pandemic, I wish everyone to contribute in the GitHub repository and always keep an eye upon our explanation on YouTube videos so that we ourselves do not spread misinformation in this critical situation.
